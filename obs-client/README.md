# OBS Scoreboard Script

## Build
`del scoreboard.zip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./src/modules; compress-archive ./src/ ./scoreboard.zip`

## Install
TODO: might deprecate this script as OBS suspends execution until a script finishes running (in this case, an infinitely running script)
